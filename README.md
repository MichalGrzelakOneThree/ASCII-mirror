<b>Description via Jet Brains Academy (educational platform):</b>

Far, far away, in the ASCII lands, there are ASCII animals that urgently need your help. Something is not right with their mirrors â€” they appear crooked. Let's help them with this anomaly and hit the road.

<b>What you'll do and what you'll learn:</b>

<b>Stage 1/5:</b>
On your way to the ASCII lands, you met a very friendly cow who says "Hello".<br>
<b>Stage 2/5:</b>
The cow asked for help with the mirror problem; to see the scale of the issue, you suggested checking it out first.<br>
<b>Stage 3/5:</b>
Let's take a tour and make new friends<br>
<b>Stage 4/5:</b>
Mirrors are strange, indeed. Let's investigate!<br>
<b>Stage 5/5:</b>
You have a clue. Let's fix the mirror thing and wave goodbye to the beautiful ASCII lands<br>
